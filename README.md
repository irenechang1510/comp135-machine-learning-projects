# COMP135: Machine Learning Projects
My projects in Tufts COMP 135: Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining class 

The first project involves working with the FashionMNIST dataset and experimenting different image data augmentation techniques to improve the machine learning model performance.

The second project involves working with the NLP techniques on Review Dataset to carry out sentiment analysis (TF-IDF)
